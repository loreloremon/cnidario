Plankton is the base of the food chain. In the sea, this food is taken to the home of many animals due to the movements of the water. So, there are many sessile organisms, spending their entire life attached to the ground. They only have to wait for the meal. And this is the case of this actinia-anemone. They flourish at night and retreat at dawn. This actinia spreads its tentacles until they are touched by a microorganism. In that moment, the sticky tentacle bends quickly towards the mouth, located in the center of its circular top part, to introduce the delicious meal inside its body. Normally, they take a piece from time to time. However, the presence of my light attracted a lot of planktonic organisms and the anemones enjoyed a feeding frenzy.
