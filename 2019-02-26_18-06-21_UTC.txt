Jellyfish! Caravela portuguesa! Portuguese Caravel! Água-viva! This creature looks like an alien! Something from other world! I had fear when I was younger because of its toxins! You feel that your skin is burning! Despite the pain it may grieve, it is a very peculiar specie! My preferred name to her is caravel. Because when she is floating on the oceans it looks like a caravel‘s sail!  I love them!
